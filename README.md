# Personal Rocket Projects
This repository will document all my personal projects using small, low altitude rockets.
My aim with this is to demonstrate my engineering expertise, and hold myself accountable for doing projects I am interested in.
I will continue to add to this repo as I fly more rockets.

## L1 Certification Attempts
Basic, unguided rocket using a solid rocket motor and little to no electronics.
Will be used to get more experience with rockets.
