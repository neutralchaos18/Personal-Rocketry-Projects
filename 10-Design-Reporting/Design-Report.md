## Rocket Motor Classification
'Hobby' or 'amateur' rocketry typically use solid rocket motors (APCP) for propulsion. Rocket motors are supplied by approved manufacturers, and are classified by their impulse class.
High-power rockets have certain restrictions on who can manufacture them and where they can be flown.
L1's are the smallest high-power rocket level, and can reasonably be constructed and certified by individuals with limited experience (Below table).

| Classification | Letter Code | Upper Impulse Range (Ns) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mid-power | Less or equal to G | 160 |
| L1 | H, I | 640 |
| L2 | J, K, L | 5120 |
| L3 | M, N, O | Greater than 5120 |

## L1 Rocket Certification
L1 rockets are typically unguided, uncontrolled, single stage sounding rockets.
Their recovery system is triggered by a timed explosive charge attached to the motor, ejecting a parachute from the top of the rocket body.
They do not require any electronic systems (unless as a payload).

To perform an L1 certification flight (https://www.tripoli.org/Level1):
- The certification flight may occur at any insured launch.
- The certifying member (designated Range Safety Officer) must be present and witness the certification flight.
- The certifying member must see the rocket ascend stably and descend in a manner controlled by the recovery system.

The rocket must be verified to be in a sufficient condition after launch that it could be launched again without repair (though the motor needs to be replaced).
The recovery system must have been deployed successfully, the fins and body structure must be undamaged, and the rocket must be in one piece (if not staged).

# L1 Rocket, First Attempt - "Dart"
## Mission
Prior to launch, the recovery system (parachute and protective cloth) will be packed into the rocket and the motor will be installed into the motor assembly.
The rocket will undergo a safety review by the designated RSO, verifying that there are no obvious flaws with the construction of the rocket and verifying that the simulated flight parameters meet the minimum safety criteria.
The rocket will be slid onto the launch rail, and the ignition charges will be fed into the motor from the rear of the rocket.
        
When approved by the RSO, the rocket motor will be ignited and the rocket will launch.
The rocket will rapidly accelerate and ascend unguided to an altitude around 0.7-2 km in the air.
An ejection charge will be triggered around the peak of the rocket's trajectory, deploying the parachute intact.
The rocket will slowly descend to the ground, slowed by the parachute.
People on the ground will visually track the rocket as it returns to the earth, and note down the bearing of it's landing site.
Once grounded, the rocket will be recovered by ground teams on foot.

## Requirements
The rocket system must satisfy the following requirements:
- The rocket shall use an L1-class APCP solid rocket motor, exceeding 5:1 ratio of initial thrust to gross lift-off weight.
- The rocket shall be passively fin-guided, with a stability calibre exceeding 1.3 off the launch rod, and below 2.0 overall.
- The rocket shall utilise a parachute recovery system, with a decent rate below 9 m/s.
- The rocket shall utilise two launch lugs for a 1010 rail profile, with the lower lug positioned at the centre of mass.

## Conceptual Design
### System Architecture
Below is a breakdown of the sounding rocket system elements:
- **Nose cone** Ogive nose cone, manufactured in PLA using FDM. The cone surfaces were sanded to a smooth finish. There is an attachment point for a shock cord.
- **Body tube** ID60x660 mm cardboard body tube. Wall thickness of 2 mm.
- **Thrust structure** Consists of a thrust ring at the base of the motor, centring ring at the top of the motor, and the tabs of the fins. Motor tube is a ID38x220 mm cardboard tube, with wall thickness of 1 mm. 
- **Fins** Trapezoidal fins, specified to be no greater than 3 mm thickness. Fin tabs are XXX
- **Recovery system** Parachute and Nomex package that is ejected through the top of the body tube.
- **Launch guides** 1010-rail lugs.

### Nose Cone
The nose cone is selected to be 'ogive' as it is the most efficient shape for subsonic rockets.

### Body Tube
The rocket is designed around a medium (60x660 mm) Auspost mailing tube.
These tubes are designed to be physically robust against loading from all directions.

### Thrust Structure
The thrust structure is responible for securing the rocket airframe to the motor.
It transfers the thrust force into the body tube and constrains the motor from exiting the tube.

### Fins

### Recovery System

### Launch Guides
