# Requirement extended description
Derived from Tripoli Safety Code, 11-1 (https://www.tripoli.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=795696&module_id=520420)
>A rocket shall be launched only if it has a recovery system designed to return all parts of the rocket to the ground safely and at a landing speed not to exceed 35 feet/second (11 meters/second).Â  Higher landing speeds may be approved by the BoD before the flight.

Specifying 9 m/s gives a little bit of margin, and 9 m/s is already quite fast for components that may be vulnerable to shock.

A parachute is specified as the recovery system as a technical constraint. Parachutes are the simplest and most reliable recovery system, and is compatible with the in-built motor ejection charge.
