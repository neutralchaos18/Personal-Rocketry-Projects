# Requirement extended description
Derived from Tripoli Safety Code, 7-1.4 (https://www.tripoli.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=795696&module_id=520420);
>The thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket typically should be at least 5:1. However, the RSO may approve a thrust-to-weight as low as 3:1 ratio.Â  Initial thrust-to-weight ratios lower than 3:1 may only be authorized by an RSO if an active stability system is included.

GLOW - Gross Lift-Off Weight, i.e. weight including the initial mass of the rocket motor.
RSO - Range Safety Officer
# Verification details
Review thrust curve and compare to estimated GLOW of rocket. GLOW estimation may be done through OpenRocket trajectory simulation; [[50-System-Trees/dart/TEST001 - Trajectory simulation via OpenRocket|TEST001 - Trajectory simulation via OpenRocket]]
