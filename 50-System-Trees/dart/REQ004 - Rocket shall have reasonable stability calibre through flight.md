# Requirement extended description
Rocket shall have a stability calibre exceeding 2.0 off the launch rod, and not significantly above 3.0 overall

Derived as technical constraint.
- Rocket must have a minimum stability off the rod as to not endanger others at the launch site. Usually a minimum stability value of 1.3 is used, but constraining the minimum stability value to 2.0 gives a comfortable margin for new rocket flyers.
- A maximum stability calibre is defined so the rocket isn't *too* likely to fly into the wind and travel a significant distance away from the launch site. If that occurs, the rocket will be fine but it will be more likely that the rocket is lost.
