>Tripoli members may not test or fly motors at a Tripoli Launch, which exceed their High-Power Certification level except Certified MotorsÂ flown as a certification flight.

...and Tripoli Safety Code 13-1 (https://www.tripoli.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=795696&module_id=520420)
>Except for certification flights, all flights and static motor tests conducted at aTripoli Launch shall be conducted within the flier's current certification level.

I at the time do not have an L1 certification, and so I am restricted to using low-power L1 motors only for certification flights.
