# Description
The continuity test is a check made by the launch control system to ensure that there is electrical continuity through the igniter. This is done by passing a high voltage low current signal through the ignition line that is not enough to ignite it. Make sure to look away while this occurs. Continuity test only takes a fraction of a second, and will occur at expected intervals (i.e. someone has to consciously trigger the test). The launch control system will emit a high pitched tone as the continuity test is occuring.
## Event
[[50-System-Trees/dart/0-conops/EVENT001 - Preflight|EVENT001 - Preflight]]
## Type
#safety-risk
# Assessment
## Hazard
Continuity test performed by launch control system will result in a high voltage arc being generated in line of sight of operators.
## Risk
High voltage arc can damage eyes to anyone looking at arc in the immediate area.
## Current controls
Person carrying out continuity test will announce this and warn people in area to look away. People will look away before the continuity test occurs. Continuity test only takes a fraction of a second.
## Consequence
Temporary blinding and some permanent damage to eyes.
## Likelihood
Has not been known to happen.
# Control
